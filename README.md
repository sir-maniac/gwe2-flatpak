## Current status

This repository is **archived** and kept **for historical reference** only.  
No updates, issues, or pull requests will be processed.

The Flatpak App ID **`com.leinardi.gwe`** is tied to my personal namespace and will not receive new builds.

## Want to take over maintenance?

If you’d like to maintain GWE or a compatible fork:

1. **Fork** the main GWE repository from  
   👉 [https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe)

2. **Publish your own version** under a **different identifier**, for example:
   - `io.github.<yourname>.GWE`
   - `org.example.GreenWithEnvy`

3. **Create a new Flatpak manifest** in your fork or submit a new app request to [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) following their [app submission guidelines](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission/).

This approach ensures clear ownership and avoids confusion with the archived package.
